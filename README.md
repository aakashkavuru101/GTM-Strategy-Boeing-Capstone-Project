# Boeing BR&T Japan: Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) GTM Case Study

This repository presents a comprehensive Product Marketing Go-To-Market (GTM) case study analyzing Boeing's strategic initiative to establish a global research and development center for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) in Nagoya, Japan. The case study examines Boeing's approach to entering an emerging sustainable technology market through strategic partnerships, government collaboration, and leveraging established industry relationships. This was the Capstone project for my business school in 2023 in Nagoya, Japan at NUCB Business school.

## Case Study Overview

In March 2023, Boeing established the Boeing Research and Technology (BR&T) center in Nagoya, Japan, in partnership with Japan's Ministry of Economic, Trade and Industry (METI). This initiative represents a strategic pivot toward sustainable aviation solutions, addressing the global imperative for decarbonization in the aviation industry while positioning Boeing as a leader in the Japanese SAF market.

## Project Purpose

This GTM case study serves as a comprehensive analysis of real-world product marketing strategy in a complex, emerging technology market. It demonstrates:

*   **Complex B2B Marketing:** Navigating multiple stakeholder groups with different needs and decision-making processes
*   **Emerging Technology Commercialization:** Strategies for bringing innovative sustainable technology to market despite cost and infrastructure challenges
*   **Long-term Market Development:** Building an ecosystem approach to create and develop an entirely new market category
