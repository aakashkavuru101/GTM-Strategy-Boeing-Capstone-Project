# Sales and Distribution Channels: Boeing BR&T Japan - Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs)

Boeing's sales and distribution strategy for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) in Japan is highly collaborative and relationship-driven, reflecting the B2B nature of the product and the complex ecosystem of the aviation industry. Unlike a typical product launch, SAF adoption requires a multi-stakeholder approach, integrating direct engagement with airlines, strategic partnerships, and leveraging government channels.

## Sales Channels

### 1. Direct Sales & Account Management (Airlines)

**Focus:** Engaging directly with major Japanese airlines (ANA, JAL) and other regional carriers to secure long-term SAF purchase agreements and integrate SAF into their operations.

**Approach:**
- **Strategic Account Management:** Dedicated Boeing account teams will work closely with airline executives, procurement, and operations teams.
- **Consultative Selling:** Educating airlines on the benefits of SAFs, including environmental compliance, brand enhancement, and long-term operational stability.
- **Technical Integration Support:** Providing expertise on SAF compatibility with existing aircraft and infrastructure.
- **Contract Negotiation:** Developing customized long-term offtake agreements for SAF supply.

**Key Activities:**
- Regular meetings with airline leadership to align on sustainability goals and SAF adoption roadmaps.
- Presenting technical and economic benefits of SAFs.
- Facilitating pilot programs and demonstrations.
- Negotiating and closing multi-year supply contracts.

### 2. Government Engagement & Advocacy

**Focus:** Working closely with the Japanese government (METI, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism - MLIT) to shape favorable policies, secure funding, and streamline regulatory processes for SAF adoption.

**Approach:**
- **Policy Advocacy:** Providing data and insights to support the development of SAF mandates, tax incentives, and carbon credit schemes.
- **Joint Initiatives:** Collaborating on government-led programs and research initiatives related to sustainable aviation.
- **Funding Applications:** Securing government grants and subsidies for SAF production and infrastructure development.

**Key Activities:**
- Regular dialogues with government officials and policymakers.
- Participation in government task forces and advisory committees.
- Joint press conferences and public announcements to promote SAF initiatives.

## Distribution Channels

### 1. Strategic Partnerships (Supply Chain & Production)

**Focus:** Establishing and leveraging partnerships with key players across the SAF value chain to ensure reliable production, supply, and distribution.

**Approach:**
- **Production Partnerships:** Collaborating with energy companies (e.g., ENEOS Holdings) to establish and scale SAF production facilities within Japan.
- **Feedstock Sourcing:** Partnering with agricultural and waste management companies for sustainable feedstock supply.
- **Blending and Logistics:** Working with fuel blenders and logistics providers (e.g., Neste) to ensure efficient delivery of SAF to airports.

**Key Activities:**
- Joint ventures and investment in SAF production infrastructure.
- Long-term supply agreements for feedstocks and blended SAF.
- Collaborative development of new production technologies.

### 2. Industry Consortia & Alliances

**Focus:** Participating in and leading industry-wide initiatives to accelerate SAF adoption, share best practices, and build a collective market for sustainable aviation.

**Approach:**
- **ACT FOR SKY:** Active membership in this consortium to catalyze SAF development and usage in Japan.
- **Global Aviation Alliances:** Engaging with international bodies (e.g., ICAO, IATA) to align on global SAF standards and targets.
- **Cross-Industry Collaboration:** Working with non-aviation sectors (e.g., automotive, chemical) that have relevant expertise in sustainable fuels.

**Key Activities:**
- Participating in working groups and committees to develop industry standards.
- Joint marketing and awareness campaigns for SAFs.
- Sharing research findings and technical expertise.

### 3. Airport & Infrastructure Development

**Focus:** Collaborating with airport authorities and fuel infrastructure providers to ensure the necessary facilities are in place for SAF storage and distribution.

**Approach:**
- **Infrastructure Planning:** Providing technical guidance for the design and implementation of SAF-compatible fueling systems at airports.
- **Investment Advocacy:** Advocating for public and private investment in airport SAF infrastructure.
- **Pilot Projects:** Conducting pilot programs at key airports to demonstrate SAF handling and logistics.

**Key Activities:**
- Feasibility studies for SAF infrastructure upgrades.
- Engagement with airport operators and fuel suppliers.
- Demonstrating successful SAF deliveries and usage at airports.

## Sales Enablement

To support these channels, Boeing will invest in comprehensive sales enablement:

*   **Technical Documentation:** Detailed specifications, safety data sheets, and performance reports for SAFs.
*   **Economic Models:** ROI calculators and cost-benefit analyses for airlines adopting SAFs.
*   **Case Studies:** Showcasing successful SAF integrations and their impact on airline sustainability goals.
*   **Training Programs:** Providing technical and commercial training for internal sales teams, partners, and airline personnel.
*   **Public Relations & Thought Leadership:** Leveraging media and industry events to educate the market and build confidence in SAFs.

By integrating these sales and distribution channels, Boeing aims to create a robust ecosystem that not only sells SAFs but also facilitates their widespread adoption and contributes to the long-term sustainability of the aviation industry in Japan and beyond.
