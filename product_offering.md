# Product/Service Offering: Boeing BR&T Japan - Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs)

Boeing's product offering in Japan extends beyond traditional aircraft manufacturing to encompass a comprehensive ecosystem of sustainable aviation solutions. The Boeing Research & Technology (BR&T) center in Nagoya represents a strategic pivot toward developing, producing, and scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) as a core product offering in the Japanese market.

## Value Proposition

Boeing's SAF value proposition in Japan addresses critical industry pain points while aligning with national sustainability goals and market demands:

### Primary Value Drivers

**Environmental Impact Reduction:**
- Direct contribution to Japan's net-zero emissions goal by 2050
